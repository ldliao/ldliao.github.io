I'm currently a **Biostatistics** PhD Candidate at **University of California, Berkeley.** My research focuses on improving causal design and analysis to address epidemiological problems. I have the privilege being co-advised by [Dr. Samuel D. Pimentel](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~spi/) and [Dr. Alejandro Schuler](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/alejandro-schuler/).\

Outside of work, I enjoy creating art, spending time with friends, and strumming on the ukulele.
